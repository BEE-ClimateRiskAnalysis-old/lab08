        "[`Turing.jl`](https://turinglang.org/dev/docs/using-turing/) is a probabilistic programming framework which primarily implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, but also allows the use of Random-Walk Metropolis-Hastings (with [`AdvancedMH.jl`](https://github.com/TuringLang/AdvancedMH.jl)) and integrates well with Julia's [Flux](https://fluxml.ai/) machine learning and differentiation packages.\n",

Monthly averages are convenient, because they are approximately the length of a tidal cycle, which is one source of correlation which can impact treating observations as independent.

In this case, we don't need any covariates, because our model is just based on a time index.\n",

        "A key part of [the Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808) is to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of the model. For example, if the posteriors are too narrow, that might suggest that the prior was too restrictive (or it might not! This is just one piece of evidence). This can also guide assessments of the assumptions made when specifying the residual structure and/or the likelihood, or if there were issues with the sampling procedure.\n",
        "\n",
        "A common category of Bayesian model diagnostics are *posterior predictive checks*, which can be [visual](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01449) or [quantitative](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/A6n41.pdf). These allow us to use the generative qualities of a Bayesian model to evaluate whether the posterior predictive distribution $p(\\hat{y} | y)$ adequately captures key patterns in the data. For example, we can write a function to simulate pseudo-data from a subsample of the MCMC chain. \n",
